Coded a chess engine with minimax alpha beta pruning. First time trying this type of project. Coding chess with all of the special moves and intricacies was difficult enough, yet I still wanted to make an engine.
- The engine works amazing compared to what I expected. There are still bugs when the depth is raised above 2, although 2 is still pretty strong.
- I tested the engine against a 1000 elo bot on chess dot com and my engine won overwhelmingly by checkmate (80% accuracy).
- The primary flaw that exists currently is that the bot will infinitely repeat moves

The code is messy although I didn't want to focus on writing it perfectly and cleanly as this is my first time and I just wanted an introduction into the space.
